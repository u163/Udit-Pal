    <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
    <b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b>
     <i>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</i> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
    <p> It was popularised in the 1960s with the <del> bule </del><ins> red</ins> of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum </p>
